(a) Source of Data : The data and csv files were from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anud3ep/valorant?select=teams.csv
 and the website states the author as Alex useranme : anud3ep

(b) Descriptions: The tables defined are as follows

agents:

Holds data for individual agents that are in the game of Valorant. Specifically stats gathered during a 3 month
period of professional play pertaining to each individual character.  

maps:

Holds data for each Valorant map containing statistics gathered during the same 3 month period of professional play
pertaining to each map.

players:

Holds data for each player in Valorants pro-scene and maps each player to a professional team held in the team teams table
while keeping track of statistics gathered during the same 3 month period of professional play pertaining to each player.

teams:

Holds data pertaining to each Valorant team with statistics gathered during the same 3 month period of professional play
containing important statistics during that period of play. 


(c) Mapping Challenges: I had a challenge storing certain values as floats since some of the numbers contained in the 
csv files needed to be stored as numeric or else a truncation error arose. I also had issues figuring out how to store
percentages and instead opted to store them as VARCHAR for simplicity. The FOREIGN KEY constraint that references a 
players team to team names also had issues with certain players on a team that wasnt stored in the teams csv
so I truncated the data down so I no longer had those issues also because the amount of players in professional play was
over 3000 players and I felt that would be too many insertions. 

(d) Non-Trivial Queries: 

1. What was the average kills per round of all players on Cloud9's team?
2. Of agents with a higher than 20% pickrate had the best average damage per round ADR?
3. Of players with a higher than 1.0 K/D were on a team have the us country code?
